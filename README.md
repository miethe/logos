## Adding Logos

All SVG files should be optimized prior to adding. This can be done with the popular tool SVG Optimizer, either directly via the [CLI](https://github.com/svg/svgo), the [SVGOMG UI](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/), or otherwise.

By using the including SVGO config, you can optimize the size and rendering of SVGs by 25-50% or more, as well as fix scaling issues from missing ViewBoxes.

Example Command:

```bash
$ svgo "file/path/*" --config=./svgo.config.js
```
